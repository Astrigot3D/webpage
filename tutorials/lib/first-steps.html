                    <h2 id="introduction-what-is-blender">1. Introduction: What is Blender?</h2>
                    <p>Blender stands as a uniquely powerful and versatile tool in the world of digital creation. It is a comprehensive, free and open-source 3D creation suite, developed as a public project hosted on blender.org. Governed by the GNU General Public License (GPL), Blender is owned by its contributors and is perpetually free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, for any purpose, including commercial and educational use. This open-source nature fosters a vibrant global community of artists, designers, developers, and enthusiasts who contribute to its rapid development and robust feature set.</p>
                    <p>At its core, Blender supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline, integrating tools for various stages of production into a single, unified software package. This makes it an exceptionally efficient tool, particularly for individuals and small studios who benefit from not needing to switch between multiple applications for different tasks.</p>

                    <h3 id="primary-uses">Primary Uses:</h3>
                    <p>Blender's capabilities span a wide range of applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Creating detailed 3D models of characters, objects, props, and environments using a comprehensive toolset that includes polygon modeling, sculpting, curve-based modeling, and procedural geometry generation via Geometry Nodes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sculpting:</strong> Digital sculpting tools provide artistic freedom for creating organic shapes and intricate details, similar to working with digital clay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Animation & Rigging:</strong> Bringing characters and objects to life with high-quality rigging tools (skeletons, skinning) and animation features (keyframes, curve editor, dope sheets, constraints). Blender is used for short films, feature films, TV series, and advertisements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Effects (VFX):</strong> Integrating 3D elements with live-action footage, featuring production-ready camera and object tracking, masking, and compositing tools within the software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> Generating final 2D images or animations from 3D scenes using its built-in render engines:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cycles: A powerful, unbiased path-tracing engine for stunning photorealistic results.</li>
                                <li>Eevee: A real-time render engine based on rasterization, focused on speed and interactivity, excellent for previews and stylized renders.</li>
                                <li>Workbench: A basic engine optimized for viewport previews, modeling, and scene layout.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Creating realistic physical simulations for effects like smoke, fire, fluids (water, liquids), cloth, hair, and rigid body dynamics.</li>
                        <li><strong>2D Animation & Story Art:</strong> A unique feature allowing artists to draw 2D directly within the 3D viewport, combining 2D and 3D workflows, ideal for storyboarding and 2D animation production.</li>
                        <li><strong>Video Editing:</strong> A functional built-in Video Sequence Editor (VSE) for basic video editing tasks, cutting, splicing, and compositing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Game Asset Creation:</strong> Modeling, texturing, and preparing assets for use in game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scripting & Customization:</strong> Extending Blender's functionality through Python scripting (using its extensive API) and creating custom tools and add-ons. The interface itself is highly customizable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Architectural visualization, product design, scientific visualization, 3D printing, motion graphics, virtual reality (VR), and more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Blender's strength lies not just in its vast feature set but also in its community-driven development model, ensuring it remains responsive to the needs of artists and industries. It is supported by major hardware vendors and is a member of key industry foundations like the Academy Software Foundation and the Khronos Group.</p>

                    <h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements:</h3>
                    <p>To run Blender effectively, your computer needs to meet certain hardware specifications. While Blender can technically run on older hardware (older versions remain available), using the latest versions with complex scenes requires more capable components. The official requirements are categorized into Minimum and Recommended specifications.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> These specifications allow you to learn Blender and work on simple projects. However, performance may degrade significantly with complex scenes, heavy simulations, or high-resolution rendering. They represent the baseline for running the software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommended Requirements:</strong> These specifications provide a much smoother experience, enabling work on more complex projects, faster rendering, and better viewport performance. For professional work or demanding tasks, aiming for or exceeding the recommended specs is advisable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here are the official requirements as listed on blender.org:</p>

                    <h3 id="component-importance">Component Importance:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CPU (Processor):</strong> Crucial for tasks like physics simulations, complex modeling operations, and certain rendering calculations (especially with Cycles on CPU). More cores generally mean better performance for multi-threaded tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Card):</strong> Essential for viewport performance, real-time rendering with Eevee, and accelerated rendering with Cycles (using CUDA/OptiX for NVIDIA, HIP for AMD, Metal for Apple Silicon, OneAPI for Intel). VRAM (GPU memory) is critical; more VRAM allows for larger textures and more complex scenes to be handled by the GPU. An NVIDIA RTX GPU is often recommended for optimal performance, especially with Cycles.</li>
                        <li><strong>RAM (Memory):</strong> Affects how many applications you can run simultaneously and the complexity of scenes Blender can handle before slowing down. More RAM allows for larger scenes, higher resolution textures, and smoother multitasking. 32 GB is often recommended for serious work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> An SSD (Solid State Drive), especially an NVMe SSD, significantly reduces file loading and saving times compared to traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives).</li>
                        <li><strong>Peripherals:</strong> While Blender can be used with a standard keyboard and a two-button mouse or trackpad, a three-button mouse is highly recommended for efficient navigation. A graphics tablet (pen tablet/display) is beneficial for tasks like sculpting, texture painting, and Grease Pencil drawing.</li>

                    <p>Blender's interface, while highly customizable, has a default layout designed to provide access to its vast array of tools. Understanding the main components is the first step to navigating the software effectively. The interface is primarily composed of different Editors, each contained within an Area. You can change the type of editor within any area using the Editor Type selector, usually found in the top-left corner of the area's header.</p>
                    <p>The key components beginners should familiarize themselves with are:</p>

                    <h3 id="3d-viewport">3D Viewport:</h3>
                    <p>This is the main window where you interact with your 3D scene. You view, select, move, and modify objects here. It provides a visual representation of your models, lights, camera, and other scene elements. The 3D Viewport itself contains several regions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Header:</strong> Contains menus (e.g., View, Select, Add, Object) and controls specific to the current mode and viewport settings (like shading options, overlays, and transform orientations).</li>
                        <li><strong>Toolbar (Left Side):</strong> Displays tools relevant to the current mode (Object Mode, Edit Mode, Sculpt Mode, etc.). Tools like Move, Rotate, Scale, Extrude, and various selection tools are accessed here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sidebar (Right Side):</strong> Accessed by pressing 'N' or dragging its edge, it contains panels for item properties (transform, dimensions), tool settings, view settings, and add-on panels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Asset Shelf (Bottom/Optional):</strong> Provides quick access to reusable assets like poses or brushes depending on the mode.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="outliner">Outliner:</h3>
                    <p>Typically located in the top-right, the Outliner displays a hierarchical list of all the data in your Blender file (.blend file). Its purpose is to organize and provide an overview of your scene's contents. You can use it to:</p>

                        <li>View scene structure (objects, collections, cameras, lights, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Select and deselect objects (selection syncs with the 3D Viewport by default).</li>
                        <li>Hide or show objects in the viewport or render.</li>
                        <li>Enable or disable object selectability.</li>
                        <li>Manage collections (grouping objects) by dragging and dropping.</li>
                        <li>View object parenting relationships.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="properties-editor">Properties Editor:</h3>
                    <p>Usually found in the bottom-right, this editor contains the bulk of the settings and properties for the active object, scene, render engine, materials, modifiers, physics, and more. It is organized into vertical tabs, each dedicated to a specific context:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active Tool & Workspace: Settings for the current tool and workspace.</li>
                        <li>Render: Settings for the chosen render engine (Cycles, Eevee, Workbench).</li>
                        <li>Output: Resolution, frame range, file format, output path.</li>
                        <li>View Layer: Passes for compositing.</li>
                        <li>Scene: Units, gravity, rigid body world settings.</li>
                        <li>World: Background color, environment lighting.</li>
                        <li>Object: Transform values, collections, visibility.</li>

                        <li>Particle Systems: Create and manage particle effects.</li>
                        <li>Physics: Add physics simulations (cloth, fluid, rigid bodies).</li>
                        <li>Constraints: Apply constraints to objects.</li>
                        <li>Object Data: Properties specific to the object type (mesh data, curve settings, light properties, camera settings).</li>
                        <li>Material: Create and edit materials.</li>
                        <li>Texture: (Less used now with node-based workflows, but still present).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="timeline">Timeline:</h3>
                    <p>Located at the bottom of the default layout, the Timeline editor is primarily used for animation. It provides:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An overview of the animation's frame range (start and end frames).</li>
                        <li>The current frame indicator (Playhead).</li>
                        <li>Display of keyframes for selected objects.</li>
                        <li>Transport controls (Play, Pause, Skip frames) for animation playback.</li>
                        <li>Tools for managing keyframes and markers.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Orbit (Rotate View):</strong> This action rotates your viewpoint around a central point of interest, allowing you to see the scene from different angles.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mouse: Click and drag the Middle Mouse Button (MMB).</li>
                                <li>Numpad: Use Numpad 4/Numpad 6 (left/right), Numpad 8/Numpad 2 (up/down), Numpad 9 (switch to opposite view).</li>
                                <li>Navigation Gizmo: Drag the multi-colored axis gizmo in the top-right corner of the viewport. Clicking an axis on the gizmo aligns the view to it (e.g., clicking X gives a side view).</li>
                            </ul>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Zoom In/Out:</strong> This action moves your viewpoint closer to or further away from the point of interest.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mouse: Scroll the Mouse Wheel (Wheel) up or down. Alternatively, hold Ctrl and drag the MMB up or down.</li>
                                <li>Numpad: Use Numpad Plus (Zoom In) and Numpad Minus (Zoom Out).</li>
                                <li>Navigation Gizmo: Click and drag the magnifying glass icon on the navigation gizmo.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Press Shift + B, then click and drag LMB to define the zoom area. Dragging with MMB after Shift+B zooms out.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Dolly View:</strong> Moves the viewpoint forwards or backwards, independent of the zoom center. This is useful when you reach the zoom limit because you've hit the orbit point.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Hold Shift + Ctrl and drag MMB up or down.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Frame Selected:</strong> Zooms and centers the view on the currently selected object(s). Extremely useful if you get lost or want to focus on a specific item.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Numpad Period (.).</li>

                    <p>Object Mode is the default mode in Blender, used for manipulating objects as whole units – positioning, orienting, and sizing them within the scene.</p>

                    <h3 id="selecting-objects">Selecting Objects:</h3>
                    <p>Before you can manipulate an object, you need to select it. Selection in Object Mode works as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Select Single Object:</strong> Click on an object with the Left Mouse Button (LMB). The selected object becomes the Active Object and is outlined in yellow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add/Remove from Selection:</strong> Hold Shift while clicking LMB on an object. This adds an unselected object to the current selection or removes an already selected object. If adding, the newly clicked object usually becomes the Active Object.</li>
                        <li><strong>Box Select:</strong> Press B, then click and drag LMB to draw a rectangle. All objects partially or fully within the rectangle will be added to the selection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Circle Select:</strong> Press C to activate a circular selection brush. Click and drag LMB over objects to add them to the selection. Scroll the Wheel to change the brush size. Press RMB or Esc to exit Circle Select mode.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lasso Select:</strong> Hold Ctrl and drag RMB to draw a freehand lasso shape. Objects within the lasso will be added to the selection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select All:</strong> Press A to select all selectable objects in the scene.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deselect All:</strong> Press Alt + A (or double-tap A quickly in some configurations) to deselect everything.</li>
                        <li><strong>Invert Selection:</strong> Press Ctrl + I to deselect currently selected objects and select all previously unselected objects.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="transform-operations">Transform Operations (Move, Rotate, Scale):</h3>
                    <p>The fundamental transformations are Move, Rotate, and Scale. These can be initiated using keyboard shortcuts, the Toolbar tools, or the 3D Gizmo. Using shortcuts is often the fastest method.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move (Grab):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Press G.</li>
                                <li>Action: After pressing G, move the mouse to reposition the selected object(s) freely in the viewport. The movement is relative to your screen view initially.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rotate:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Press R.</li>
                                <li>Action: After pressing R, move the mouse to rotate the selected object(s) around the pivot point.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Scale:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shortcut: Press S.</li>
                                <li>Action: After pressing S, move the mouse towards or away from the pivot point to scale the selected object(s) down or up.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="confirming-and-canceling">Confirming and Canceling:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Confirm:</strong> After initiating a transform (G, R, or S) and positioning the object with the mouse, click LMB to confirm the transformation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Press RMB or Esc to cancel the transformation and return the object(s) to their original state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="axis-locking">Axis Locking:</h3>
                    <p>Often, you'll want to constrain transformations to a specific axis (X, Y, or Z). This provides precision and control.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Method:</strong> After initiating a transform (G, R, or S), press X, Y, or Z to lock the transformation to the corresponding global axis. For example, pressing G then X will only allow movement along the global X-axis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plane Locking:</strong> To constrain the transformation to a plane (e.g., move only on the XY plane, excluding Z), press Shift + [Axis Key]. For example, G then Shift + Z allows movement along the global XY plane.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Axis:</strong> Pressing the axis key twice (e.g., G then X then X) locks the transformation to the object's local axis, which is useful if the object has been rotated.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="numerical-input">Numerical Input:</h3>
                    <p>You can also perform precise transformations by typing numerical values.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Method:</strong> After initiating a transform (G, R, or S) and optionally locking an axis (X, Y, Z), type a number and press Enter. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>G X 5 Enter: Moves the object 5 units along the global X-axis.</li>
                                <li>R Z 45 Enter: Rotates the object 45 degrees around the global Z-axis.</li>
                                <li>S 2 Enter: Scales the object to twice its size uniformly.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mastering selection and these basic transformations in Object Mode is essential for arranging your scene and preparing objects for more detailed work.</p>

                    <p>Blender utilizes different Modes to allow editing of various aspects of an object. For beginners, the most crucial distinction to understand is between Object Mode and Edit Mode.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Object Mode:</strong> As covered previously, this mode treats objects as whole entities. You select, move, rotate, and scale entire objects. You work with the object's overall position, orientation, and size in the scene, and manage object-level properties like modifiers and materials. This is the default mode for most objects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edit Mode:</strong> This mode allows you to modify the actual geometry or internal structure of an object. What you can edit depends on the object type:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Meshes: You can select and manipulate individual Vertices (points), Edges (lines connecting vertices), and Faces (surfaces enclosed by edges). This is where most detailed modeling occurs.</li>
                                <li>Curves/Surfaces: You edit control points that define the shape.</li>
                                <li>Grease Pencil: You edit strokes and points.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="switching-between-modes">Switching Between Modes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shortcut:</strong> The primary way to switch between Object Mode and Edit Mode for a selected, editable object (like a mesh) is by pressing the Tab key. Pressing Tab toggles between the two modes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mode Selector:</strong> You can also use the Mode dropdown menu in the 3D Viewport header.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Entering Edit Mode changes the available tools in the Toolbar and the options in the viewport header, providing tools specifically for geometry manipulation.</p>

                    <p>When you enter Edit Mode for a mesh object, you gain access to its underlying components. You need to choose which type of component you want to select and edit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Selection Modes:</strong> Buttons in the viewport header (or keyboard shortcuts) allow switching between:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Vertex Select: Allows selecting individual vertices. Shortcut: 1 (top number row, not numpad).</li>
                                <li>Edge Select: Allows selecting edges. Shortcut: 2 (top number row).</li>
                                <li>Face Select: Allows selecting faces. Shortcut: 3 (top number row).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="note">
                                <h4>Note: Multiple Selection Modes</h4>
                                <p>Holding Shift while pressing 1, 2, or 3 allows enabling multiple selection modes simultaneously.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once in the desired selection mode, you can select vertices, edges, or faces using the same methods as selecting objects in Object Mode (LMB, Shift+LMB, B, C, etc.). Selected components can then be transformed using the G (Move), R (Rotate), and S (Scale) keys, including axis locking, just like objects in Object Mode.</p>

                    <h3 id="basic-modeling-operation-extrude">Basic Modeling Operation: Extrude:</h3>
                    <p>Extrusion is a fundamental modeling technique used to create new geometry by extending selected components.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tool: Extrude Region</li>
                        <li>Shortcut: E.</li>
                        <li>Action:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Enter Edit Mode (Tab) for your mesh object.</li>
                                <li>Switch to Face Select mode (3).</li>
                                <li>Select one or more faces you want to extrude (LMB or Shift+LMB).</li>
                                <li>Press E. Blender duplicates the selected face(s) and connects them to the original geometry with new faces along the edges.</li>
                                <li>Move the mouse to determine the direction and distance of the extrusion. By default, faces extrude along their average normal (perpendicular direction).</li>
                                <li>Click LMB to confirm the extrusion, or press RMB/Esc to cancel.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can also extrude vertices (creating edges) and edges (creating faces) using the same E shortcut. The Extrude tool is incredibly versatile and forms the basis of many modeling workflows. There are several variations of the extrude tool (e.g., Extrude Individual, Extrude Along Normals) accessible via Alt + E or the Mesh > Extrude menu.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the difference between Object Mode (manipulating the whole) and Edit Mode (manipulating the parts) is essential for modeling in Blender.</p>

                    <h2 id="applying-basic-materials-and-textures">6. Applying Basic Materials and Textures</h2>
                    <p>Giving your 3D models color and surface detail involves applying Materials and often Textures.</p>

                    <h3 id="applying-basic-materials-shader-editor">Applying Basic Materials with the Shader Editor:</h3>
                    <p>Materials define how the surface of an object interacts with light – its color, shininess, roughness, transparency, etc. In Blender (especially for the Eevee and Cycles render engines), materials are typically created using a node-based system in the Shader Editor.</p>

                    <h3 id="steps-to-apply-material">Steps to Apply a Basic Material:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Select the Object:</strong> In Object Mode, select the object you want to apply a material to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Go to Material Properties:</strong> In the Properties Editor, click on the Material Properties tab (icon looks like a sphere).</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a New Material:</strong> If the object doesn't have a material yet, click the "+ New" button. This assigns a new material slot and creates a basic default material. If it already has a material slot, ensure it's selected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open the Shader Editor:</strong> Switch one of your editor areas to the Shader Editor. You can also use the dedicated "Shading" workspace, which conveniently sets up a 3D Viewport (in Material Preview mode) and a Shader Editor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examine the Default Nodes:</strong> When you create a new material, Blender automatically sets up a basic node tree:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Principled BSDF Node:</strong> This is the main shader node. It simulates a wide variety of real-world materials (plastic, metal, glass, etc.) using physically-based principles. It has inputs for Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, Specular, Transmission, Emission, etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>Material Output Node:</strong> This node represents the final output for the material. It has inputs for Surface, Volume, and Displacement.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Connect Nodes (Default):</strong> By default, the "BSDF" output socket (green dot) of the Principled BSDF node is connected to the "Surface" input socket (green dot) of the Material Output node. This connection tells Blender to use the Principled BSDF shader to define the object's surface appearance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust Properties:</strong> You can now change the material's appearance by modifying the values in the Principled BSDF node. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Click the color swatch next to "Base Color" to choose a new color.</li>
                                <li>Adjust the "Roughness" slider (0 = shiny, 1 = matte).</li>
                                <li>Increase the "Metallic" slider towards 1 to make it look like metal.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Preview:</strong> Ensure your 3D Viewport is set to "Material Preview" or "Rendered" shading mode (using the buttons in the top-right of the viewport header) to see the material changes in real-time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This basic setup using the Principled BSDF node is incredibly powerful and allows for the creation of many common materials just by adjusting its parameters.</p>

                    <h3 id="introduction-to-uv-unwrapping">Introduction to UV Unwrapping for Textures:</h3>
                    <p>While solid colors and procedural effects can be achieved with materials alone, applying image textures (like wood grain, fabric patterns, or detailed character skins) requires UV Unwrapping.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Concept:</strong> UV unwrapping is the process of "flattening" the 3D model's surface onto a 2D plane, creating a UV map. Think of it like carefully cutting seams on a cardboard box so you can lay it flat. The 2D coordinates on this flat map are called U and V (to distinguish them from 3D X, Y, Z coordinates).</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The UV map tells Blender how to wrap a 2D image texture around the 3D object's surface. Each point (UV vertex) on the 2D map corresponds to a vertex on the 3D mesh.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="general-uv-workflow">General Workflow:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Mark Seams:</strong> In Edit Mode, select edges on your 3D model where you want the "cuts" to occur during flattening. Press Ctrl + E and choose "Mark Seam". Good seam placement is crucial to minimize stretching and distortion in the final texture. Think about where seams would naturally occur on a real-world object (like clothing seams).</li>
                        <li><strong>Unwrap:</strong> Select the faces you want to unwrap (often the entire model by pressing A in Edit Mode). Press U to open the UV Mapping menu and choose an unwrapping method (e.g., "Unwrap", "Smart UV Project").</li>
                        <li><strong>Edit UVs:</strong> The resulting 2D UV map appears in the UV Editor. You can select, move (G), rotate (R), and scale (S) the UV vertices, edges, faces, or entire islands (connected groups of UVs) in the UV Editor to optimize the layout, minimize distortion, and fit the texture image appropriately.</li>
                        <li><strong>Apply Texture:</strong> In the Shader Editor, add an Image Texture node (Shift + A > Texture > Image Texture), load your desired image file into it, and connect its "Color" output to the "Base Color" input (or other relevant inputs) of the Principled BSDF node. Ensure the Image Texture node is using the correct UV map (usually the default "UVMap").</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>UV unwrapping is a skill that takes practice, but it's essential for applying detailed image textures to your models.</p>

                    <h2 id="basic-lighting-and-rendering">7. Basic Lighting and Rendering</h2>
                    <p>Once you have modeled and applied materials to your objects, the next steps are to light the scene and render a final image or animation.</p>

                    <h3 id="setting-up-simple-lighting">Setting Up Simple Lighting:</h3>
                    <p>Lighting dramatically affects the mood and realism of a scene. A common and effective starting point is Three-Point Lighting, a standard technique used in photography and cinematography. It uses three main light sources:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Key Light:</strong> The primary light source, providing the main illumination and defining the primary shadows. It's typically the brightest light and is often placed at an angle (e.g., 45 degrees) to one side of the camera and slightly above the subject.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fill Light:</strong> Positioned on the opposite side of the camera from the key light, the fill light softens the shadows created by the key light. It's usually less intense than the key light (e.g., 50% intensity) to maintain some contrast and dimension.</li>
                        <li><strong>Back Light (Rim Light):</strong> Placed behind the subject, often opposite the key light, this light illuminates the subject's edges from behind. It helps separate the subject from the background by creating a subtle outline or "rim" of light, adding depth.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="steps-for-basic-three-point-lighting">Steps for Basic Three-Point Lighting:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Add Lights:</strong> In Object Mode, use Shift + A > Light and choose a light type. Common choices for this setup are Point, Spot, or Area lights. Repeat to add three lights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Position Lights:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Place the Key Light to one side and slightly above the subject, angled towards it.</li>
                                <li>Place the Fill Light on the opposite side, also angled towards the subject.</li>
                                <li>Place the Back Light behind the subject, potentially higher up, aimed at the subject's back/edges.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust Intensity and Properties:</strong> Select each light and go to the Object Data Properties (light bulb icon) in the Properties Editor. Adjust the Power (intensity). Make the Key light brightest, the Fill light dimmer (e.g., half the Key's power), and the Back light potentially similar to or less than the Fill. For Spot lights, adjust the Size (cone angle) and Blend (softness of the edge). For Area lights, adjust the Shape and Size. Experiment with light Color as well.</li>
                        <li><strong>Preview:</strong> Use the "Rendered" viewport shading mode to see the lighting effect in real-time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="note">
                        <h4>Tip: Tri-lighting Add-on</h4>
                        <p>Blender has a built-in "Tri-lighting" add-on that can automatically create a basic three-point setup around the selected object. Enable it in Preferences > Add-ons > Lighting, then find it under Shift + A > Light > Three Point Lights.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 id="rendering-your-scene">Rendering Your Scene:</h3>
                    <p>Rendering is the process of generating the final 2D image from your 3D scene based on the camera's view, lighting, materials, and render settings.</p>

                    <h3 id="steps-for-basic-rendering">Steps for Basic Rendering:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Position the Camera:</strong> Every scene needs a camera. If you don't have one, add it (Shift + A > Camera). Select the camera and position/rotate it (using G and R) to frame your desired shot. You can look through the camera view by pressing Numpad 0.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose a Render Engine:</strong> Go to the Render Properties tab (camera icon) in the Properties Editor. Select your desired Render Engine:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Eevee:</strong> Real-time engine, generally faster, good for previews and stylized looks. Uses rasterization techniques.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cycles:</strong> Path-tracing engine, more physically accurate (realistic lighting, reflections, refractions), but slower to render. Uses ray tracing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Workbench is primarily for viewport display, not final renders. The choice depends on your project's needs for speed versus realism. Materials created with nodes generally work in both Eevee and Cycles, though results may differ.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust Render Settings (Basic):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Output Properties (printer icon): Set the Resolution (e.g., 1920x1080 pixels for Full HD) and Frame Range (if animating). Choose the Output Path and File Format (e.g., PNG, JPG for images; FFmpeg video for animations).</li>
                                <li>Render Properties (camera icon): Adjust Sampling settings (Render samples) for quality (higher samples reduce noise but increase render time). Eevee and Cycles have different specific settings to explore (e.g., Ambient Occlusion, Bloom for Eevee; Denoising, Light Paths for Cycles).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Render Image: Press F12 or go to the Render menu > Render Image.</li>
                                <li>Render Animation: Go to the Render menu > Render Animation (ensure Frame Range and Output Path are set correctly).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
